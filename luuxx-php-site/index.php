                            installed in our home. Michael and his team were professional, friendly and very knowledgeable and 
                            provided us with an excellent service. The house dates from the 1770s, which meant that the 
                            installation presented some fairly considerable challenges – LUUXX overcame these with good grace 
                            and honoured their original quote (despite the additional time and labour involved).

                            value of build circa £1.8million. From the start everything was explained properly and professionally, 
                            ts and demonstrations of how things work were also given at previous jobs completed. The CCTV, Alarm 
                            system, TV, Music network, cinema room, lighting system and electric gates were all installed with 
                            total professionalism showing great pride in their own work. Throughout the build nothing was too 
                            much trouble even when tweaks in design were requested.<br>My Thanks go to Michael and his team for a 
                            great job!

                        <p class="testimonial-text">I commissioned LUUXX to complete a large project at my new home which involved 
                            audio visual, security, smart lighting and home automation. Having run my own electrical firm, the work 
                            LUUXX completed was close to home for me, but I was left very impressed by the level of craftsmanship 
                            and engineering to integrate so many different technologies.<br>
                            The crown jewel was the cinema room which LUUXX produced lifelike 3D images to help me envisage the 
                            design. The result was an amazing sounding and looking room that me and my family will enjoy for many years.

                            and always felt that Michael put my best interests first rather than just me being a business transaction. 
                            The result was a fantastic smart home and media room that went well beyond my expectations. <br>
                            I would not hesitate to recommend LUUXX.
